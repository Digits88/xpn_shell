XPN Shell for python exploit developers.

This module provides exploit developers with a shell like environment 
without worrying about having to write a UI each time they develop an
exploit.

The implementation is very simple, and is easily extended with commands
and variables.

THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR METASPLOIT
========================================

As if ;). Metasploit is a full framework, this is just a simple UI for exploit
developers. The reason for its creation is my need for creating portable
exploits without taking the full metasploit framework with me.

This module can be imported or the exploit can be added to the end of the module
and distributed as one file (see example at the tail of this file)

Example:

# Typical usage for this module should be as follows:

class my_l33t_exploit(Exploit):
	def __init__(self.....)
		self.name = "My L33t Exploit"
		self.description = "A description of my L33T Exploit"

	def run(self, ui):
		param1 = ui.get_var("param1")
		param2 = ui.get_var("param2")

		# Leet exploit stuff here #

		ui.print_info("Host Exploited")

		# More leet stuff here #

		ui.print_warning("Unable to gain r00t")

exploit_obj = my_l33t_exploit()
exploit_ui = ui()
exploit_ui.title = "L33T Exploit!"
exploit_ui.add_var("param1", "Hostname to target", "127.0.0.1", required=True)
exploit_ui.add_var("param2", "TCP port to target", 8080, required=True)
exploit_ui.add_exploit(exploit_obj)
exploit_ui.run()
